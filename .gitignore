# We ignore migrations for now if they are specific to local sqlite, but normally you commit them.
# However, user wants to deploy to Vercel later which needs Postgres.
# Best to ignore sqlite db file but KEEP migrations if possible, but SQLite migrations differ from Postgres.
# For simplicity, let's ignore the dev.db.
dev.db
dev.db-journal
